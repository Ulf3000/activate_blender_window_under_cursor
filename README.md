# activate_blender_window_under_cursor
activates a blender window if its under the cursor , Auto Hotkey AHK script

this script enables auto activating of blender windows under the cursor. 

windows10 has a similar function build in which is activated according to this guide:

(edit: the ahk script now does this for you , ease of access settings dont stick after restart for me so im just activating right from the script)

The build in Win10 function doesnt work between different blender windows though! thats why i made this script (put it in autostart folder)

then you have convinient auto activation of all your windows in windows10/8
