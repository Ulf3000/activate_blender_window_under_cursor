# activate_blender_window_under_cursor
blender has a convinient way of switching context by the the position the mouse is hovering , 

this fails though when you use multiple windows, like for example putting your shadereditor or curve editor on a second monitor.

You then always have to click the window first, which is confusing and if unlucky you unselect everything or select the wrong Keyframe/object/node/whatever

this script takes care of that. So if blender is the active app , it will automatically activate the different blender windows under the cursor 

---------------------------

run the blender_console_ontop.ahk script also, to get your console window back and it not vanishing behind the blender window. it ensure that the blender console window is set to always ontop upon opening
