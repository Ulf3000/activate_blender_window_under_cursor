# activate_blender_window_under_cursor
activates a blender window if its under the cursor , Auto Hotkey AHK script

this script enables auto activating of blender windows under the cursor. 

windows10 has a similar function build in which is activated according to this guide:

but it doesnt work between different blender windows! thats why i made this script , so in addition to windowsÂ´s own function start this autohotkey script(put it in autostart folder)

then you have convinient auto activation of all your windows in windows10/8
